    "The founders of a small business based in the neighborhood 'Parco Nord', one of the peripherical neighborhood of the italian northern city of Milan, are witnessing an explosion in their activities and are no longer able to meet the ever-increasing demand of their customers.\n",
    "Eager to expand by opening a second location, they are stuck in the phase of choosing the perfect place. An accurate analysis of the current customer base, highlights that a key factor of the ongoing success is the peculiar urban environment, made of sport fields, shops, restaurants, by which the current location is surrounded. The client's need is to be able to meet a customer base as similar as possible to the original one. Which areas of Milan are most similar to 'Parco Nord' in terms of inhabitants' and visitors lifestyle? Applying machine learning techniques, we are going to segment and cluster the city, trying to find out similarities and dissimilarities among its 84 neighborhoods."
